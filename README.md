# Terraform-Three-Tier
Three Tier project with terraform, I took my AWS three thier project and created it in Terraform, Still needs and ASG added
This includes a Web Tier, App Tier, and a Database Tier. 
There is two route tables, one internal and one external
A Bastion host is also created in this project so that there can be more secure SSH only from my local IP. 
The Web Tier servers have NGINX on them
